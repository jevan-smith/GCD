## Project Goals
1. Implement several algorithms related to computing the GCD(m, n) of two integers m and n. 
2. Empirically determine the run-time complexity for different kinds of input (average-case / worst-case).
3. Write a short report summarizing the outcome of project in form of tables and scatter-plots.

## Requirements
- Built using python 3.7
- matplotlib is required (Version 3.0.2)
-- matplotlib.pyplot
-- matplotlib.patches
